### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Ran Isenberg. 
I'm an [AWS Community Builder](https://aws.amazon.com/developer/community/community-builders/), a Principal Software Architect, a blogger: [Ran The Builder](https://www.ranthebuilder.cloud), and a public speaker.

I design and build Serverless services on AWS for a living.

I love all things Serverless at AWS and maintain a [blog](https://www.ranthebuilder.cloud) where I share my knowledge and experience in the Serverless world.

I'm a big believer in open-source projects and have started open-source projects.

I have donated features to other open-source projects. The most prominent of them is [AWS Lambda Powertools](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-python).
